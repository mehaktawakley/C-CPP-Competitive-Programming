"""
Given the first 2 terms of Arithmetic Series tell the nth term of the series. 

Input:
First line contains an integer, the number of test cases 'T'. Each test case in its first line should contain two positive integer a and b(First 2 terms of AP). In the second line of every test case it contains of an integer N.


Output:
In each seperate line print the Nth term of the Arithmetic Progression.


Constraints:
1<=T<=30
-100<=a<=100
-100<=b<=100
1 <= N <= 100


Example:
Input:
2
2 3
4
1 2
10

Output:
